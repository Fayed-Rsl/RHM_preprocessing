# This script has been made in order to quickly start analysing the MEG-LFP Dataset refering to this article: doi...
# For example purposes, preprocessing has been implemented only for a specific: subject, session, task, acquisition.
# One would need to adapt the following code in order to make analyse on the whole dataset as it is examplified in run_coherence.py
# Feel free to modify the script as pleased.
# INFORMATION: You would need to change the bids_root to make it match with the location of the bids_dataset
